    <div class="w3-row">
      <p class="w3-padding">Don Quixote was written in 1605 (Part I) and 1615 (Part II) by  Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra in Spain.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">When it was first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the French Revolution it was popular in part due to its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting—not comic at all.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">In the 19th century it was seen as a social commentary, but no one could easily tell "whose side Cervantes was on".</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's innate idealism and nobility are viewed by the world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">By the 20th century the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="w3-row">
      <p class="w3-padding">Ulysses was written by James Joyce in Ireland. It was first published in parts in an American journal between 1918 and 1920.  It was published in its entirety in 1922, and is classified as one of the great modernist novels.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Literary modernism is characterized by a self-conscious break with traditional styles of poetry and verse </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">One reason it is important is because it featured a regular guy, rather than a king or queen or other nobleman, which was less common at that time.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The story takes place on June 16, 1904, which is now celebrated as Bloomsday by Ulysses fans, named after the main character. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The book is known by some as difficult to read or challenging to follow, but worth the time and effort.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">Lolita is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, written in English and published in 1955 in Paris and 1958 in New York.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">After its publication, Lolita attained a classic status, becoming one of the best-known and most controversial examples of 20th century literature. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The novel is notable for its writing style and controversial subject - a man's sexual obsession with a 12-year-old girl.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The novel was adapted to film by Stanley Kubrick in 1962, and again in 1997 by Adrian Lyne.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The name "Lolita" has entered pop culture to describe a sexually precocious girl.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">Nineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The novel is set in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain), a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The superstate is under the control of the privileged elite of the Inner Party, a party and government that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as "thoughtcrime", which is enforced by the "Thought Police".</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, works for the Ministry of Truth, which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. His job is to rewrite past newspaper articles, so that the historical record always supports the party line.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Nineteen Eighty-Four popularised the adjective Orwellian, which describes official deception, secret surveillance, and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">It was criticized upon release because of its coarse language and became even more controversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial stereotypes.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">It explores main themes of racism and slavery, as well as the conflict between freedom and orderly civilization. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">To highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes – which anyone would agree was the right thing to do – he then immediately encounters Jim "illegally" doing the same thing.</p>

      <h3 class="">The Odyssey</h3>
      <h4 class="w3-text-grey">Chapter 6</h4>
      <h5 class="w3-text-grey">From Cliffs Notes</h5>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-row">
      <p class="w3-padding">“Be strong, saith my heart; I am a soldier; I have seen worse sights than this.”  Homer -- The Odyssey</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The poem, written by Homer about 700 BC, mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (known as Ulysses in Roman myths) and his journey home after the Trojan War. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">While Odysseus battles mystical creatures and faces the wrath of the gods, his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus stave off suitors vying for Penelope's hand and Ithaca's throne long enough for Odysseus to return.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The Odyssey ends as Odysseus wins a contest to prove his identity, slaughters the suitors, and retakes the throne of Ithaca.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The Odyssey is an epic, a very long poem on a single subject. Some epics were composed in order to be performed from memory, and so they include poetic devices to make them more memorable. And many epics, probably including The Odyssey, were written to be performed to musical accompaniment.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The journey of Odysseus from Troy to Ithaca takes ten years — the same amount of time that the Trojan War itself lasted - though it should take just a few weeks.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Odysseus's most memorable quality is not his bravery or strength — though he is brave and strong — but rather his cleverness.</p>
