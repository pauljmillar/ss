    <div class="w3-row">
      <p class="w3-padding">10,000 years ago, there were no more than 10 million people on the earth. This relatively large population forced the domestication of plants and animals to ensure their survival.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Even the primitive agriculture practiced then could support up to fifty times more people than hunting and gathering could. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Agriculture allowed individual families to farm their own lands.  As a result, private property evolved which led to social classes and more conflict in society between rich and poor.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Year-round mating (a random mutation that replaced the seasonal estrus cycle that occurs in most mammals) and food sharing created permanent bonds that we have come to know as the family.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were the first animals to be domesticated between 8000 BC and 6500 BC. Horses were domesticated next, around 3000 BC, which had an impact on war (mounted warfare) and communication (mounted messengers).</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">The oldest know city was Jericho, dating back to c.8000 B.C.E., making it twice as old as the Egyptian pyramids.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The first civilizations arose along hot dry river valleys in Egypt, Mesopotamia, northwest India, and China. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Over time, irrigation would lead to more crops, which led to more people, which led to the need to develop more farmland and irrigation.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The continued expansion of population and farmland to feed it eventually led to cities clashing over new lands.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Dance, with possible origins in ancient hunting techniques, became a critical part of early communities. The communities, in turn, have played a significant role in helping our social species to survive through the ages.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">War likely existed between hunter-gatherer groups over hunting territory, but intensified with agriculture, which gave rise to larger populations, land, possessions, and walled civilizations.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Before 2400 BC, a defender in a war could stay within the sun-baked bricks of their fortifications until the invaders gave up.  The invention of the battering ram changed that.  </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The invention of the horse drawn chariot and compound bow revolutionized warfare again in 1800 BC, and led to empires overthrown and power shifts.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The next innovation was a lightly armed infantry throwing javelins to bring down charioteers and their horses, which played a part in the Trojan War.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The Iron Age (1000-1500 BC) would equip armies with new tools and armor, but also created new riches, which were incentives to go to war. </p>

      <p class="w3-padding">It is generally agreed that true writing of language (not only numbers) was invented independently in at least two places: Mesopotamia (specifically, ancient Sumer) around 3200 BCE and Mesoamerica around 600 BCE.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The earliest known writing for record keeping evolved from a system of counting using small clay tokens.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Tallies made by carving notches in wood, bone, and stone were used for at least forty thousand years. Roman numerals evolved from this primitive system of cutting notches.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The Phoenician alphabet is simply the Proto-Canaanite alphabet as it was continued into the Iron Age (conventionally taken from a cut-off date of 1050 BC). This alphabet gave rise to the Aramaic and Greek alphabets.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Writing gave rise to expanded trade routes, and kings could keep the tax and census records necessary for expanding their city-states into empires. And of course, literature, poetry, and history. </p>

      <p class="w3-padding">In modern day Iraq between 2800-2350 B.C.E., along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Mesopotamia presented a harsh environment to inhabit, but also an ideal one in which to build the first civilization.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The Sumerians were the people who built the first civilization, living in the southeastern end of Mesopotamia known as Sumer.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">When the Sumerians finally emerge into history, we find them divided into thirteen major city-states who spent a good deal of their time fighting each other.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Each city-state also wanted to control the holy city of Nippur, which led to constant fighting that caused Nippur to change hands nineteen times in twenty-four years.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the Old Kingdom, fueled by the increased agricultural productivity made possible by a well-developed central administration.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The Great Pyramid of Giza was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Other Ancient Egyptian achievements include a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty with Hittites</p>
