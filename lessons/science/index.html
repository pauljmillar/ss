      <p class="w3-padding">The Earth of the early Archean may have supported a tectonic regime unlike that of the present. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Life may have started by a series of chemical reactions that produced simple organic compounds: An experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of lightning.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Current phylogenetic evidence suggests that the last universal ancestor (LUA) lived during the early Archean eon, perhaps 3.5 Ga or earlier.[81][82] This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today. It was probably a prokaryote, possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes, but lacking a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">The first the first proto-mitochondrion may have been formed this way: A bacterial cell related to today’s Rickettsia,[93] which had evolved to metabolize oxygen, entered a larger prokaryotic cell, which lacked that capability, and the smaller cell survived inside the larger cell.  The smaller cell replicated inside the larger one. Soon, a stable symbiosis developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it.  </p>

      <p class="w3-padding">The Mesozoic era began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the largest well-documented mass extinction in Earth's history, and ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, another mass extinction which is known for having killed off non-avian dinosaurs, as well as other plant and animal species. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The P-Tr extinction event is the Earth's most severe known extinction event, with up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species becoming extinct. The recovery of life after the event may have taken 10 million years.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding">The Cenozoic Era began 65 million years ago and continues today. It is also known as the Age of Mammals, because the extinction of many groups allowed mammals to greatly diversify.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The era begins as the dinosaurs die in an extinction event. It is generally believed that the K–Pg extinction was triggered by a massive comet/asteroid impact and its catastrophic effects on the global environment, including a lingering impact winter that made it impossible for plants and plankton to carry out photosynthesis.</p>

    <div class="w3-row">
      <p class="w3-padding">Plate tectonics is a scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of 7 large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the Earth's lithosphere, over the last hundreds of millions of years. </p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The theoretical model builds on the concept of continental drift, an idea developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge and drag, with downward suction, at the subduction zones. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the Sun and Moon.</p>    
      <p class="w3-padding">The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the fluid-like (visco-elastic solid) asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40 mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160 mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows).</p>
